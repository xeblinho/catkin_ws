[33m[1mCMake Warning[0m at /home/jetson/dso/catkin_ws/src/dso/CMakeLists.txt:34 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibzmq.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "libzmq", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libzmq" with any
  of the following names:

    libzmqConfig.cmake
    libzmq-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libzmq" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libzmq_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "libzmq"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.


CMake Warning (dev) at /opt/cmake-3.20.5-linux-x86_64/share/cmake-3.20/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (LIBZIP)
  does not match the name of the calling package (LibZip).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
