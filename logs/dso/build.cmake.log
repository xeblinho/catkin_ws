  Add the installation prefix of "libzmq" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libzmq_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "libzmq"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been

CMake Warning (dev) at /opt/cmake-3.20.5-linux-x86_64/share/cmake-3.20/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (LIBZIP)
  does not match the name of the calling package (LibZip).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
